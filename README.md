# Topic Modelling using LDA
# Introduction
In NLP(Natural Language Processing), Topic Modelling is used to identify and extract abstract topics from large collections of text documents. It uses algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent topics present in the text and represent documents as a mixture of these topics.<br>

 # Data
The dataset used is from Kaggle's A million News Headlines. The data contains 1.2 million rows and 2 columns namely "publish date" and "headline text". "Headline text" column contains news headlines and "publish date" column contains the date the headline was published.<br>

# Objective
The goal of this project is to perform topic modelling on a dataset of news headlines to show the topics that stand out and uncover patterns and trends in the news.<br>

The second objective of this project will be to have a  visual representation of the dominant topics, which can be used by news aggregators, journalists, and individuals to quickly gain a broad understanding of the current news landscape.
